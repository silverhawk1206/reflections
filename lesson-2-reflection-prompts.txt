What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The .git file is added to the working directory. You need this because that
	file is what Git uses to operate.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is a type of pseudo-directory that allows you to prepare
	files that you want to commit. The value of this ability is that you don't
	have to commit every file in your working directory, nor do you have to commit
	each file separately; you can decide which files you want to commit, stage
	them, then commit that group of files!

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
