When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Any time that I'm working on a collaborative project.
  When I'm needing to share my code with someone.
  If I want to store my code externally for safety/backup reasons.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because code could have been added that would mess with your code. By allowing you
  to control the versions of the various code files in your repository, you have much
  more control over your working environment.
